# SavvyMart-A-Voice-Assistant-Smart-Shopping-Market

SavvyMart is a voice assistant e-commerce website which primarily focuses on meeting the customers’ expectations. As today, customers not only want just a typical shopping website but a lot more than it. Keeping the same in our mind we have worked on this project and gave an amazing transition to the traditional online markets. The whole website of SavvyMart is animated which means whenever a user will click on something he/she will see a lovely animation which makes it interesting to use. Apart from animated user interface, we have also implemented a voice assistant named SAM with the help of which customers can listen to the description of the products instead of just reading it. We have also given importance to language barriers which means SAM can speak both in HINDI and ENGLISH providing a smooth and reliable customer experience. SavvyMart is a multi-vendor online market which means one can not only buy but also can sell their products using this platform.

## Conclusion

After researching and implementing this project SavvyMart we can conclude that now-a-days mostly people prefer to buy goods online as it saves their time and they can buy or sell their products on just one click. We have also concluded that there are several online markets available on the internet and to increase traffic on your online shop you should implement some advanced modules on your website which will attract customers to buy from your market. Considering these points in SavvyMart the advanced modules which we have implemented to increase traffic are Animated User Interface and Voice Assistant which is known as SAM. We have implemented SAM both in English and Hindi language and in future we are planning to implement SAM in SANSKRIT language too. Through this research work we can surely say that Voice based E-commerce Websites are the future of Online Shopping.
